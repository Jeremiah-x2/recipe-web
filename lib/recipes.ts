        'InstructionsTake the uncooked red potatoes and place them into the Instant Pot. Cover with 2 cups of water, or more if needed. Place the lid securely into place, set the valve to "seal" and then put the Instant Pot on manual for 8 minutes.When the cooking time is finished, allow the Instant Pot to naturally release pressure for 10 minutes before moving the valve t0 "vent". I always cover mine with a hand towel just in case any thing decided to spurt out of the lid.Once the pressure has been released, remove the inner pot and drain the excess water.Place the potatoes into a bowl and add cream cheese, butter, milk, sour cream, and salt and pepper. Mash the potatoes really well and mix everything up good. Add in the chopped green onion and mix again. Serve immediately or save them for later.',

      instructions:
        "Make the pastry: Place the cut up butter pieces in the freezer for 15 minutes to chill. Meanwhile, in the work bowl of a food processor combine flour, sugar, dry mustard, salt and cayenne pepper. Pulse to combine. After the butter has chilled, scatter the pieces over the flour mixture (still in the food processor), along with the cheddar. Pulse about 10 times. Sprinkle half the ice water over the dough, pulse about 3 times, repeat with remaining water, pulsing 3 more times. Pinch the dough to check if it sticks together, if not add a tablespoon or two more ice water, until it comes together. Dump the mix in a large bowl and press it together to form the dough. Divide dough in half, shaping each into a 4-inch disk. Wrap each piece in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least an hour.\nBegin the filling: Pat the meat dry with paper towels and season with salt & pepper. Heat 2 t. oil in a large skillet over medium high heat until just smoking. Add the meat in a single layer and cook, without stirring, until the meat browns well on the underside, anywhere between 5-10 minutes (the meat will give off liquid, just let it evaporate - leave it alone!) Stir the meat and cook another couple minutes, until it looses the raw color. Remove to a plate and set aside.\nReduce heat to medium, add the remaining 2 t. oil and the onions and carrots. Saute until softened and starting to brown, stirring occasionally, around 5 minutes. Add the garlic, thyme and marjoram, cook until very fragrant, about a minute. Stir in flour, cook and stir about a minute. Slowly add in the beef broth and water, then the meat, along with any juices left on the plate. Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low, to med-low. Cover and cook, (adjusting the heat as necessary to maintain a simmer) stirring occasionally until the meat is just becoming tender, around 45 minutes. Remove from heat, add in the Dijon and parsley. Adjust seasoning with salt & pepper. Set aside to cool.\nRolling out the crust, filling & baking the pot pies: Remove the dough from the refrigerator 10 minutes before rolling it out. Roll the dough out on a well-floured surface, large enough to cut out 3, 7-inch circles out of each half (save the scraps). Line each cup of a large-sized muffin tin with the dough. (It won't look very pretty, you just kind of have your way with it to get it pressed in there.) Refrigerate the filled tins as well as the dough scraps 15 minutes to firm back up.\nMeanwhile, preheat oven to 400 degrees. After 15 minutes and the filling has cooled down quite a bit. Divide the mixture evenly between crusts. Divide the remaining dough into 6 balls. Roll out each piece wide enough to cover the pot pies. Pinch the top and bottom crust edges together to seal, and finish the edges in whatever decorative way you like. Brush the tops with the beaten egg. Bake 35-40 minutes, rotating the pan after 20 minutes. Remove from oven & let sit 5 minutes before (carefully) removing the pot pies from the tin.",

Heat until chocolate melts and then continue to simmer, covered, for 15 minutes, stirring frequently. If sauce is too thick, add water to thin as needed.\nHeat oil in a large skillet.\nSeason lamb on all sides liberally with salt and pepper, then sear in skillet until a brown crust forms on all sides.\nLay browned lamb in a piece of heavy duty aluminum foil and pour mole sauce over. Seal tightly so that no air escapes and the sauce wont leak out. (Double foil is a good idea.)\nBake at 325 degrees F for 3-4 hours, until lamb is tender and falls from the bone.",

Make a cut along the entire length of a plantain, and peel off the skin.\nSlice each plantain into thin slices. Dont worry if the slices are not perfect.\nPlace the plantains in a medium-sized bowl. Mix in all the other ingredients and stir until everything is well incorporated.\nPlace the plantain slices on the baking sheets in a single layer.\nBake for about 15-20 minutes, flipping them at about the 8- or 9-minute mark. Because of the uneven heat distribution in my oven, I also like to swap the baking sheets between the top and bottom racks.\nRemove the chips from the oven when the edges turn into a nice golden brown color.",

Pour the pudding mixture into the pan and place it in the oven. Lightly tent the pan with foil.\nBake for 1 hour, until the center is just set. (30-40 minutes for smaller pans) You may want to take the foil off the last 10-15 minutes so the top will be golden.\nServes 1, or if youre in a sharing mood 8-10.",

      instructions:
        "To prepare the skewers:\nSoak 8 bamboo skewers in water for at least 30 minutes. Set aside.\nTo make the sauce:\nCut the top of the dried chili and shake out the seeds. Transfer them into a saucepan along with the prunes, broth, tomatoes, tomato paste, onion, molasses, garlic, pumpkin seeds, cumin, and oregano. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat and cook for 2 minutes; then lower the heat to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes more.\nUsing an immersion blender, puree the mixture until completely smooth. Return to the heat and simmer, uncovered, for another 15 to 20 minutes. (If you dont have an immersion blender, carefully ladle the sauce into a food processor, and process until smooth, working in batches; then return to the pot.) Set the sauce aside until ready to serve with the corndogs, or if you are making this ahead of time, once the sauce has cooled, transfer it to a container and refrigerate.\nTo prepare the corn dogs:\nIn a mixing bowl, combine the masa harina, cornmeal,  cup of the rice flour, baking powder, brown sugar, and salt and mix to combine. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well to combine. Add the rice milk and lime juice and mix to combine. The mixture should resemble a thick pancake batter; if more milk is needed, add by the tablespoonful. Cover and refrigerate the mixture if you are not going to be frying right away.\nWhen you are ready to cook, heat the oil in a saucepan until it registers 350F on a deep-frying thermometer. While the oil is heating, place the remaining rice flour on a paper plate and set aside. Cut each chicken sausage in half crosswise, to make eight pieces.\nRoll each piece of sausage in the rice flour to lightly coat. Thread the moistened bamboo skewers through the sausage pieces, so that the tips of the skewers are not quite poking out the top. Holding it by its skewer, dip a floured sausage piece into the batter, until it is completely coated. Carefully lift the stick and hold it over the bowl for a few seconds, allowing any excess batter to drip off. Repeat with another skewer. Carefully place two corn dogs into the hot oil and cook until they are crusty on the outside, and dark golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels and keep warm. Repeat with each skewered sausage, allowing the oil to return to 350F in between. Serve immediately with the chili.",

      instructions:
        "Heat the oil in a non-stick pan.  When it reaches a medium high heat, add the shallots and garlic and saut for a minute.\nAdd the sprouts, cook until they are browned and become a little softer ( not too soft though, you dont want them to be mushy, but to retain a little bite).  You can probably get going with cooking the pasta when the sprouts are nearly finished.  Just follow the instructions on the packet for timings.  The best way to cook pasta is to put it into a pan with plenty of boiling water and a good helping of salt.\nWhen the sprouts are cooked, move them to the outside area of the pan and add the bacon to the centre, allowing it to cook for a couple of minutes, turning a couple of times.\nWhen the bacon is cooked, mix it through the sprouts and give a good grind of black pepper and a little salt.  Careful with salt as the bacon and the parmesan will also add a salty flavour.\nWhen the pasta is ready, bring your two pans close together on the stove.  Then, with tongs, grab the pasta and drag is swiftly into the pan with the sprouts.  By doing this you take in some of the pasta water.  This water helps bind and create your sauce.  You dont need  much, in this case probably about 2 tablespoons worth.  This dragging technique should ensure that you have enough.\nTurn the heat off under your sprouts and pasta.  Add the egg (not directly on to the base of the pan but onto the pasta mixture) add the parmesan.  Stir through quite quickly, this will create a creamy style sauce.\nCheck for seasoning, and serve immediately with some extra parmesan sprinkled over the top if you wish.\nThis works well with all sorts of pasta.  The only type that doesnt work so well for a carbonara style dish is whole meal or gluten free varieties.  These pastas seem to lack the starchy constituent that gives your sauce that creamy texture.\nTry using pecorino cheese instead of parmesan",

        "Heat coconut milk and half & half on the stove over medium high in a saucepan until hot and barely bubbling (bring to a low boil). Add sugar; mix to dissolve. Remove from heat.  Pour mixture into a blender along with the chopped peaches. Allow mixture to cool about 10 minutes before pouring mixture in a large container; refrigerate a few hours until cold.\nIf using an ice cream maker, follow the instructions on your ice cream maker accordingly.\nYou can also try this without an ice cream maker by putting the ice cream mixture in a freezer-safe container, placing it in the freezer and stirring with a spoon every hour for roughly 8  10 hours.  If you try this without an ice cream maker the consistency will not be as creamy as youd get when using an ice cream maker, but the ice cream will still be great!\nIf you have leftovers in the freezer, thaw the ice cream at least 10 minutes before attempting to dig in because it will be much stiffer than store-bought ice cream.",

        "<ol><li>Cut the chicken thighs into one inch sized pieces.</li><li>Add about 2 teaspoons of salt and 2 teaspoons of pepper. Or do what I always do for dishes that call for salt and pepper. I use Masterfoods Garlic Pepper. Give it a good sprinkle, about 1 tablespoon of it. Set aside to marinate for a couple of hours.</li><li>Slice the top of the tomatoes off.</li><li>Using a small spoon, scoop out the soft insides of the tomatoes. This reduces the moisture in the dish and prevents sogginess.</li><li>Chop the tomatoes up into small bits.</li><li>Chop the onions into small bits.</li><li>Place the onions and tomatoes in a large bowl.</li><li>Chop up a bunch of cilantro. Use as much or as little as you like.</li><li>Add the cilantro to the onions-tomatoes mixture. Toss together and set aside.</li><li>Cut a slit round an avocado, against its seed.</li><li>Holding each side of the cut avocado, twist the avocado open to reveal the seed.</li><li>Remove the seed and scoop out the flesh. Place the avocado flesh in a large bowl and mash it up evenly till it becomes creamy.</li><li>Add the tomatoes mixture to the avocados.</li><li>Combine well.</li><li>Squeeze in juice from one lemon.</li><li>Add a generous portion of salt to taste. About 1 to 2 teaspoons.</li><li>At this point, youll have guacamole. If you like, dish it up in a serving bowl and serve it with chips.</li><li>Now cook the chicken. Heat a pan with a few tablespoons of cooking oil till its very hot. It has to be very hot or the chicken wont brown.</li><li>Add the chicken to the pan. Be careful! Itll sizzle and splatter.</li><li>Turn the pieces over to brown the other side after a few minutes.</li><li>When the chicken are browned, remove them from the pan and set aside at a warm place.</li><li>Using a clean, dry pan, toast the tortillas one at a time on each side.</li><li>They are ready to be used when they are soft and warm.</li><li>Add a serving of the guacamole mixture.</li><li>Add a serving of the chicken.</li><li>Quickly wrap the burrito up. If it cools, the tortilla will crack and it would be impossible to roll it up.</li><li>Roll over once. Fold in the sides, and roll over again till its fully wrapped.</li><li>Serve immediately or wrap in aluminum foil and keep them in the oven till ready to eat.</li></ol>",

It is best to do both this and the next step the day or night before you plan to make the sorbet - just make sure you leave enough time for everything to freeze.\nMake the herb-infused simple syrup by combining the water and sugar in a small heavy-bottomed saucepan and heat over a medium flame until it comes to a boil. Turn it off and let cool completely.\nStrain out the mint leaves and lavender and pour the cooled syrup into an ice cube tray - should make roughly 4 syrup cubes. Place the tray in the freezer until syrup is frozen (the cubes may remain a little mushy as a result of all the sugar.)\nOnce the berries and herb-infused syrup cubes have frozen, you can make the sorbet. Place the frozen berries and syrup cubes in the bowl of a cuisinart or blender and add a few teaspoons of ice water to aid in blending. Continue to process or blend, adding small amounts of the ice water as needed, until smooth.\nServe, topped with a sprig of mint leaves and/or lavender.",

        "<ol><li>For the Chicken Tacos:</li><li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees.</li><li>Coat chicken with evoo and spices evenly on both sides, (save lime for cooked chicken.) Bake at 400 degrees for 20-25 minutes or until cooked through and juices run clear. Let cool a bit. Decrease oven temperature to 200 degrees. While chicken is cooking make the guacamole and corn salsa.</li><li>While chicken is still warm, shred with 2 forks and when shredded, squeeze lime juice over the chicken and a bit of extra salt if needed. Keep chicken warm by covering it with foil.</li><li>In a skillet on med high heat, put a small amount of canola oil or cooking spray in the pan and let heat. Cook corn tortillas until browned on both sides and place on a cookie sheet in the 200 degree oven to keep warm while finishing the rest.</li><li>Make the tacos by laying a tortilla flat and adding chicken, corn salsa, and guacamole. Top with sour cream, salsa, shredded cabbage and a lime for garnish. Enjoy!</li><li>For the Corn Salsa:</li><li>Add all ingredients to a bowl and mix well. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Keep in the frig while cooking everything else so the ingredients can meld together.</li><li>For the Guacamole:</li><li>Add all ingredients to a bowl and mix well. Coating the avocado in the lime juice will help the guacamole to stay green and not turn brown. By chopping the avocado instead of creaming it it will make the guacamole stay green for days! I like to cut the tomato and avocado about the same size but all the other ingredients I finely chop.</li></ol>",

      instructions:
        "First off, mix the flours together and whisk so they are combined well.\nThis recipe requires you to make a sponge. For this you take 1/2 cup of flour and place in a large bowl with the half cup warm water and the yeast. Cover the bowl with plastic and let stand anywhere from 2-8 hours. This is to allow it to ferment, I personally couldn't wait the whole time, I think I made it a minute past the 2 hour mark.\nStir in the 1 cup of water a little at a time. Add in the salt and just enough of the flour to make the dough pull away from the sides of the bowl.\nTurn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead enough flour to make a soft dough. It should be smooth and elastic. Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turning to coat the dough ball lightly, and cover. Place in a warm place where a draft cannot get to it and allow to rise about 1 hour.\nPrep a large baking pan (pizza pan works well) by either taking an oiled napkin and running it around the pan or line with parchment paper.\nPunch the dough down and allow to rest 10 minutes.\nOil your hands and place dough in the pan. Brush the top of the dough with oil then, using your fingers, make deep dimples in the dough, about 1/2 inch. Cover with plastic again and let rest in a warm place for 30 minutes.\nPreheat the oven to 400F(200C).\nTake the olives, feta and basil and spread on top of the foccacia. Sprinkle salt on top and place in oven. Bake 18 - 20 minutes  or until golden. Check about half way through and deflate any large bubbles with the poke of a knife.\nWhen done cooking, place on a rack to cool for about 15 - 20 minutes.\nThis bread is very versatile. You can make it into small mini loaves (as in the original recipe) or in a big one like I did. You can also top it with a number of different ingredients, just let your craving drive you :D!",

        "Cooking Method:\nSeason the chicken with salt and pepper and heat the olive oil in a large saut pan. Brown the chicken pieces (in batches if necessary) over a high heat with the garlic and thyme for 23 minutes on each side until golden brown. Return all the chicken to the pan, add the vinegar and bubble until reduced by half. Drizzle over the soy sauce and honey and shake the pan to mix.\nPour in a 1/2 cup of hot water and add the lemon slices. Let the liquid bubble and reduce down until syrupy, which will take about 10 minutes or so. By now the chicken should be cooked through.\nTransfer the chicken to a platter and sprinkle over the chopped parsley.\nServe with mashed potato (boil potatoes, add milk and butter and mash together, add cooked peas and carrots and some thyme).",

        "<ol><li>Step 1: Prepare the frosting by melting the chocolate in a double broiler. When the chocolate has melted, add heavy cream and coffee extract. Mix well and chill in the refrigerator until needed. Dont combine the mascarpone cheese, yet.</li><li>Step 2: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F and line the cupcake pan with Halloween baking cups. In a large bowl, combine the the cake flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li><li>Step 3: In another large mixing bowl, mix together the oil, sugar, egg, and vanilla and coffee extract and mix well. Then add the buttermilk and mix well again.</li><li>Step 4: Now stir in the flour mixture and mix until well combined.</li><li>Step 5: Pour the batter into a ziploc or piping bag and pipe into the cupcake pan. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean (I baked mine for about 24 minutes).</li><li>Step 6: Let the cupcakes cool in the pan for about 5 to 10 minutes and then transfer them to a rack to cool completely.</li><li>Step 7: While cupcakes are cooling, make the chocolate decorations. Melt the chocolate and use a ziploc or piping bag to pipe out your design onto some parchment paper. Sprinkle the halloween sprinkles before the chocolate hardens. Chill in freezer until needed.</li><li>Step 8: Finish the frosting. Using an electric mixer, beat the mascarpone cheese until light and fluffy. Add the cooled chocolate cream mixture from earlier and beat until combined.</li><li>Step 9: Roughly spread the frosting on the cooled cupcakes. Dust with cocoa powder and decorate with sprinkles and chocolate.</li></ol>",

        "In pie pan/deep dish add your Italian bread crumbs.\nIn large enough pan to fit at least two fillets at a time, add about 1 cup of oil and bring up to a sizzling temp. (after frying about half the fish, you may need to add more oil to the pan)\nIf frozen thaw your tilapia in lukewarm water, drain well.\nOnce oil is ready, take one of the fillets, thoroughly coat both sides with the bread crumbs.  Place in the oil and cook til each side is brown (~2-3 minutes/side).  Place on sheets of paper towel to drain away more of the oil.\nLightly season the top side of fish with you salt or creole seasoning.\nWhile frying up the rest of your fillets, chop up all of your accouterments.\nWhen everything is ready, microwave your tortillas for about 30 seconds on high, completely covered in paper towel or a clean dishtowel.\nMake a taco building buffet: add your fish, a little queso, your veggies, a pinch of cilantro, and then salsa and/or guac. Use the lime wedges to give your taco a little extra kick of citrus!",

In a separate large bowl, whisk together ricotta, egg yolks, milk, lemon zest and vanilla. Stir flour mixture into egg mixture just until combined.</li><li>Beat egg whites with an electric mixer at high speed until soft peaks form.

Pour heaping 1/4 cup batter onto griddle and spread to make about 4-inch pancake. Drop about 10 blueberries onto each pancake. Cook 3 minutes, or until edges are dry and bottom is golden. Flip pancake and cook 2 to 3 minutes longer or until lightly golden on both sides. Adjust heat as needed to prevent burning. Place pancakes on a heatproof platter and keep warm in oven. Repeat with remaining batter and blueberries. Garnish with additional blueberries if desired.</li></ol>",

      instructions:
        "1.Pour the buttermilk into a tray or bowl add one teaspoon of salt, mix through and place the chicken pieces into the buttermilk. Depending on the size and shape of your bowl you may need a little bit more buttermilk in order that the chicken is covered. Cover with some cling film and place in the fridge for up to 8 hours. Remove before frying to give enough time to bring the meat up to room temperature.\n2.In a dish or bowl combine the flour, half teaspoon of salt, smoked paprika, thyme and pepper. Combine with your fingers or a fork.\n3.Remove the chicken from the buttermilk marinade and dispose of the marinade. Shake off most of the drips and then dredge the chicken in your flour mix making sure each piece is covered completely.\n4.Heat about 1.5cm / 0.5 in. of oil in a heavy bottomed wide pan. While this is heating up you can get a wire rack ready to drain the chicken. I do this by placing kitchen paper over the rack.\n5.The oil temperature should be about 170C / 340F for frying. I dont check with a thermometer but by putting a piece of bread in the oil and it is ready when it fizzes and turns brown quickly. The time the oil takes to heat up will depend on the thickness of the metal of your pan, your stove top and the quantity of oil you have used.\n6.You will probably have to cook in batches so as not to over load the pan. I start with the thighs which need a little bit more time than the legs. Place each one carefully in the pan and fry, covered, on a good strong simmer for anywhere between 8 to 12 minutes on each side. The heat needs to be high enough to give you a nice brown colour and a crisp finish. Remove and set on the rack to drain. Then do the same with the legs, giving them a couple of minutes less than the thighs.",

If you like your lamb medium rare place it in the oven for about 6-8 minutes.  If you like your lamb medium place it in the oven for 9 to 11 minutes. If you like it well done leave it in there for 12-14 minutes.  Remember, the lamb will continue to cook after you take it out so plan accordingly.</li></ol>",

      instructions:
        "<ol><li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place an 8-inch springform pan on a sheet of parchment paper and draw a circle around the circumference of the pan. Then cut the circle out. Place in the springform pan and butter the pan. Add 1 T flour and tap out any excess.</li><li>Melt the chocolate and butter in a heatproof glass bowl, as well as the 8 T of sugar, if using unsweetened sugar as I did in a double boiler. Reserve the 1/3 cup of sugar until later. Set aside chocolate and butter mixture to cool slightly, about 5 minutes.</li><li>In a separate small bowl, combine the 4 egg yolks, dissolved coffee and vanilla extract and whisk until just blended. Combine this yolk mixture with the chocolate mixture whisk until well blended.</li><li>In a very clean, large glass bowl beat the 4 egg whites on medium-high and add the cream of tartar or lemon juice and beat until soft peaks form. This should take about 3 minutes. Beat another minute while slowly adding the 1/3 cup of granulated sugar. Then beat 1 more minute. The whites should be stiff. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold the egg whites into the chocolate mixture in 3 different batches until no white streaks remain.</li><li>Pour the cake batter into the prepared springform pan and smooth the top. Bake in the oven on a center rack for about 20 minutes. The cake is done when a knife inserted comes out clean. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool for at least 1 hour. Run a knife along the edge of the pan to loosen the cake and then release the sides of the springform pan and lift off. Use a spatula to separate the cake from the bottom and lift off the parchment paper.</li><li>In a clean glass bowl, whip the whipping cream until it starts to form peaks and add the chai and powdered sugar. Continue to whip until soft peaks form. Do not over whip or it will turn into butter.</li><li>Serve with a dollop of chai-spiced whipped cream.</li></ol>",

Melt the butter over medium heat for about 1 minute.</li><li>Pour the mixture into the prepared spring form pan, completely coating the parchment paper.</li><li>Place the quartered pears on top of the butter-sugar mixture, lining the pieces up tightly in a decorative circle.</li><li>In a large mixing bowl cream butter (cut into smaller pieces) and brown sugar for 3-5 minutes, until smooth.</li><li>Add the grated ginger, and beat 1 minute more.</li><li>Add the eggs one at a time,making sure that each egg is fully incorporated before adding another.</li><li>Add in the maple syrup or honey and beat to fully mix. The mixture will look as though it is breaking or curdling, but it will come together when the dry ingredients are added.</li><li>In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk to fully combine.</li><li>Alternately add small amounts of flour and buttermilk to the batter, stirring and folding with a rubber spatula until the dry ingredients are just absorbed. Do not overmix the batter.</li><li>Pour and scrape the batter into the pear-lined pan, smoothing the top with a rubber spatula.</li><li>Bake the cake at 325F for about 1 hour and 45 minutes, until a skewer inserted in the cakes centre comes out clean.</li><li>Let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes on a wire rack.</li><li>Cover the pan with a serving plate; then carefully invert them together. Release the sides of the pan, and lift it away. Gently lift the pans base off the cake, and peel away the parchment paper.</li><li>Allow the cake to cool, and serve warm.</li></ol>",

      instructions:
        "Preheat oven to 400 F\nPlace oats in a food processor. Process until finely ground\nAdd flours, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and allspice to a food processor. Pulse 3 times\nAdd butter; pulse 5 times until mixture resembles coarse meal. Be very careful - Don't over beat.\nAdd 1 tsp vanilla and sour cream; pulse 3 times or just until combined ( DO NOT over-mix). If you're afraid you might over-mix, you can transfer the mixture into a big bowl and add sour cream and vanilla. Use spatula to mix. If you over-mix, the mixture will be too runny.\nAdd cranberries, and nuts. Use spatula to mix well.\nTurn dough out onto a lightly floured surface; knead lightly 3 times. Roll dough to a 1/2 inch thickness; cut with a 2 1/2 inch biscuit cutter\nPlace cut dough on a baking sheet. Use a watermelon scoop or small round spoon to press in a middle of each cut though to make a half hole for raspberry jam\nMix together jam and the remaining vanilla extract.\nAdd 1/2 teaspoon of jam into a hole. Don't over put it otherwise it will run all over a scone.\nBake for 14 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from baking sheet; transfer to a wire rack\nWhile they're cooling, combine powdered sugar and milk. Stir with a whisk until smooth. Drizzle the glaze evenly over scones.",

      instructions:
        "<ol><li>Preheat your oven to 375 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with foil and spray it with a nonstick spray. Season the pork tenderloin generously with the lemon pepper seasoning, rubbing it all over. Place the pork tenderloin on the prepared baking sheet and spray the pork with a nonstick spray. Place it in the oven and roast for about 45 minutes to 1 hour or until done to your liking. Use an instant read thermometer for desired level of doneness.</li><li>While the pork is roasting, prepare your crumbled cornbread. To a large bowl, add the cornbread, egg, jalapeno, parsley, green onions, salt and black pepper to taste, and milk. Stir to combine and pour it into an oven-safe baking dish that has been sprayed with a nonstick spray. Place it in the oven with pork and bake for 20 minutes or until slightly brown on top. Remove from oven and cover with foil to keep warm while you prepare the rest of your meal.</li><li>When the pork has finished roasting, remove it from the oven and pour the juices (if there are any) into a large nonstick skillet set over medium heat. Cover the pork tenderloin with a foil tent and allow it to rest for 10 minutes. Add the butter to the pan with the juices. If the pork has not released any juices, add an extra tablespoon or two of butter. Melt the butter and then whisk in the flour. Let cook for a minute or until golden brown, then whisk in the chicken broth and continue whisking until the sauce is a thick gravy. Season generously with salt and black pepper to taste. Remove from heat.</li><li>Slice the pork and set it over a bed of cornbread stuffing.</li><li>Serve with your favorite veggies and enjoy!</li></ol>",

        "<ol><li>Soak cedar plank in water for 2 hours.  Rinse salmon under cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Place a medium sauce pan over medium high heat and add bourbon or brandy.  Use caution as the alcohol can ignite; never pour directly from the bottle.   When alcohol is reduced and there is only a small amount left, add apple juice, brown sugar, and garlic.  Continue to cook over medium high heat until reduced to about  of the original volume (should be slightly thinner than syrup).</li><li>Season salmon with salt and pepper on both sides, brush skin side with olive oil and place on cedar plank, skin side down.  Place cedar plank on a medium high grill, or in a wood fired oven pre-heated to 500F near the fire.  Use a probe thermometer to check the internal temperature of the salmon after 10 minutes, and every 5 minutes or so thereafter.  Once the salmon has an internal temperature of at least 100F, brush on the apple glaze that you made earlier, repeat this step every few minutes. Cook salmon until</li></ol>",

        "<ol><li>Make Lemon Dill Hollandaise:</li><li>Fill a medium saucepan about halfway with water, and bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat. Put the egg yolks and water in a heatproof bowl, season with a pinch of dill (if using dried), salt, and pepper. Whisk the ingredients together and then place the bowl on top of the saucepan. Keep stirring the egg mixture for about 5 minutes or until it begins to thicken. Make sure you dont scramble your eggs! Once the eggs are thickened, take the bowl off the water and set aside.</li><li>Poach the eggs:</li><li>Fill a medium saucepan with water, add a splash of white vinegar (optional, but this helps hold the whites together which results in nicely shaped eggs) and bring to a gentle simmer. You want tiny bubbles only, not a rolling boil. Gently add eggs to water and poach until deisred doneness.</li><li>Meanwhile, toast bread.</li><li>Place toast on plates and top with arugula, spinach and salmon. Place eggs on top of salmon and spoon hollandaise over the top. Garnish with dill, salt and freshly cracked black pepper and serve.</li></ol>",

        "Pat dry the swordfish. In a plate mix together the panko, bread crumbs, parmesan cheese, dry sage and marjoram and the salt and pepper. Mix well.\nIn another plate place the milk or cream.\nDip the swordfish into the milk and let any excess drip away.\nRoll into the panko-parmesan mixture and press it against the swordfish to adhere.\nIn a large skillet melt 2 tablespoons of butter. When melted add the swordfish and cook until nicely golden on each side and the fish is springy yet cooked.\nRemove the swordfish from the skillet and let it rest while preparing the sauce.\nRemove all the cooking butter from the skillet and place the skillet over medium high heat.\nAdd the orange juice and reduce by half.\nAdd the butter remaining, the sugar and reduce until a thick sauce is crated.\nServe the sauce over the fish or alongside.\nIf the sauce is too thick and too tangy; add a bit more sugar and swirl in another tablespoon of butter.",
